        Welcome to our file transfer app! Our app makes it easy for you to
        quickly and securely transfer files of any type or size between devices.
        Whether you need to send a document to a colleague, share a large video
        with a friend, or backup your important files to the cloud, our app has
        you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app features a simple, intuitive interface that makes transferring
        files a breeze. Just select the file you want to send, choose the
        recipient, and hit send. Our app uses advanced encryption technology to
        ensure that your files are always secure and protected from unauthorized
        access.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to our core file transfer functionality, our app also
        includes a number of powerful features to help you manage and organize
        your files. You can easily view, edit, and delete files from within the
        app, as well as create and manage folders to keep your files organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to providing our users with the best possible file
        transfer experience, and we are constantly working to improve our app
        with new features and functionality. If you have any questions or
        feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thanks for choosing our
        app!

        <div class="feature-text">
          <h3>Collaborative editing</h3>
          <p>
            Collaborative editing: This feature allows multiple users to work on
            the same file simultaneously, with all changes made in real-time.
            Collaborative editing is particularly useful for documents,
            spreadsheets, and presentations where multiple people need to
            contribute or make changes. With collaborative editing, all users
            can see changes made by others in real-time, and there's no need to
            constantly send updated versions of the file back and forth.
          </p>

        <div class="feature-text">
          <h3>File versioning</h3>
          <p>
            File versioning: File versioning allows users to keep track of
            different versions of a file over time. This is particularly useful
            when multiple people are working on the same file, or when changes
            need to be made to a file over an extended period. With file
            versioning, users can see the changes made to a file over time, and
            can revert back to a previous version if needed. This can help
            prevent data loss or mistakes, and ensures that users always have
            access to the most up-to-date version of a file.

          <h3>Integration with other apps</h3>
          <p>
            Integration with other apps: Integration with other apps allows
            users to easily import and export files from other apps, such as
            Google Drive, Dropbox, or Microsoft Office. This is particularly
            useful for users who work with multiple apps and want to streamline
            their workflow. For example, a user could import a file from Google
            Drive directly into the file sharing website, make changes, and then
            export it back to Google Drive without ever leaving the file sharing
            website.
